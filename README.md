# 🧩 Object Oriented Programming I (Java)

This repository contains my coursework, practice codes, and lab implementations for **Object Oriented Concepts I (OOP-I)** using **Java**, following the official syllabus of the Software Engineering program.

The goal of this repository is to **master core object-oriented principles** and apply them through **clean, reusable, and maintainable Java code**.

---

## 🎯 Core OOP Pillars

This course is centered around the **four fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming**:

* 🔒 **Encapsulation** – Data hiding through access modifiers, interfaces, and controlled access
* 🧠 **Abstraction** – Abstract classes, interfaces, and minimal public interfaces
* 🔁 **Polymorphism** – Method overloading, method overriding, dynamic binding
* 🧬 **Inheritance** – Superclasses, subclasses, generalization, and specialization

Each concept is implemented with **practical Java examples**.
